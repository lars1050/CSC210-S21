#### Maze Game In-Class Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to the Netbeans debugger. It is a clever and fun use of the debugger created by Keith Schwarz (Stanford University).

The objective of the game is to find a path through the maze that passes you through locations with a spellbook, a wand, and a potion. Once you have all three, you are free and will be released from the maze.

We will walk through an example in class. Then ...

1. Set YOUR_NAME = the string of your name (or whatever you want). This string gets _hashed_ to seed the random number generator and create a unique maze just for you!

2. Set the breakpoint where indicated in Main.

3. Start the debugger (the icon to the right of the green "play" triangle).

4. Trace the maze by constructing a drawing of the maze. Indicate where all 3 items are on the drawing.

5. Determine a path (e.g. "EENNWSE") and set PATH_OUT_OF_MAZE equal to this string. Run it again to see if you have succeeded!
