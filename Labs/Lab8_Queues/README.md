### Lab 8 : Stack, Queue, DFS, BFS
#### Due Tuesday, April 6 at end-of-day
#### Submit a single zipped file to Moodle

<hr>

### Learning Outcomes:

- Understand and implement a circular queue.
- Understand and implement a stack.
- Understand and implement DFS.
- Understand and implement BFS.

<hr>

### Coding

**CLASSES**

Complete both the class Stack and class Queue. The primary operators of push and pop need to be completed. As well as the constructor and empty().

>NOTE: implementation requirements of the Queue are to use an array with a "dummy" node and head and tail, so items do not need to be shifted.

**METHODS IN MAIN**

Complete the DFS and BFS functions in the main class. Use your Stack and Queue respectively in those functions.


### DOCUMENTATION

Javadocs has been completed for you.
Inline comments are part of the requirements.

#### Assessment

Grades will be given as A,B,C,D with the numerical equivalence of 95, 85, 75, 65. "F" is not listed because that will be addressed on an individual basis depending on how much of the lab was completed.

The rubric is as follows:

- A : All code components complete, correct, and compiling. In-line comments provided in code.
- B : Few code components incomplete or incorrect and/or no comments in code.
- C : Many code components or error messages incomplete or incorrect and/or code is not commented.
- D : Minimal additions to the code.

> To be graded, your code must compile (using the specified names in the requirements above for all methods and comparators).
